# SaveFlow Lite

SaveFlow Lite is a comfort-first save workflow plugin for Godot 4. It keeps
save ownership in the scene tree instead of hiding everything inside one large
save script.

Main paths:
- `SaveFlowNodeSource` for object-owned state
- `SaveFlowTypedDataSource` for typed system/model-style state
- `SaveFlowTypedStateSource` for direct C# typed state
- `SaveFlowDataSource` for custom table, queue, registry, and adapter state
- `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource` for runtime entity sets
- `SaveFlowScope` for domain boundaries and restore order

Start with one ownership model:
- one object -> `SaveFlowNodeSource`
- one typed system model -> `SaveFlowTypedDataSource`
- one C# typed state object -> `SaveFlowTypedStateSource`
- one custom table/registry adapter -> `SaveFlowDataSource`
- one runtime set -> `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource` + `SaveFlowPrefabEntityFactory`

Default runtime entity path:
- `SaveFlowPrefabEntityFactory`

Advanced runtime entity path:
- custom `SaveFlowEntityFactory`

Package rule:
- a normal install should contain `addons/saveflow_core` and `addons/saveflow_lite`
- `docs-site`, `tmp`, `.github`, `tests`, and release tooling are repository-only paths

Editor debugging flow:
- `Compatibility` tells you whether the slot satisfies the current schema/data-version policy
- `Restore Contract` tells you whether the expected scene is already active
- `Slot Safety` tells you whether the primary file is healthy and whether backup recovery is available
- the `SaveFlow` validator badge in the 2D/3D editor menu preflights the current scene for duplicate source keys, invalid plans, and misplaced pipeline signal bridges
