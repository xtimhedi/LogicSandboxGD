# SaveFlow Lite Roadmap

This document defines what should continue to improve in `SaveFlow Lite`.

The goal is not feature flood.
The goal is:

- cleaner first-time adoption
- fewer integration mistakes
- stronger baseline reliability
- clearer project-level save configuration

## Lite Product Rule

`Lite` should own:

- the base save graph model
- the main user-facing entry points
- the cleanest possible default workflows
- the baseline reliability users need to trust the product

`Lite` should not try to compete with `Pro` by piling on advanced commercial features.
It should get better by becoming:

- clearer
- safer
- easier to configure
- easier to debug

## Main Lite Update Lines

### 1. Entry Path Polish

Continue refining:

- `SaveFlowNodeSource`
- `SaveFlowTypedDataSource`
- `SaveFlowDataSource`
- `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource`
- `SaveFlowScope`

Goals:

- fewer misconfigurations
- less hidden behavior
- better inspector guidance
- clearer defaults

### 2. Unified Save Settings Panel

This is now a key Lite roadmap item.

Target problem:

- project-level save settings are currently spread across code, autoload behavior, and per-source decisions
- users need one obvious place to manage global save defaults

Lite should add a unified settings surface for things like:

- save format
- default slot behavior
- version metadata
- save-file metadata
- backup policy at the project level
- editor-facing project save settings

The panel should make it easier to answer:

- what format does this project save with?
- what version is the current save schema?
- what metadata is stored with save files?
- what global save defaults are active?

This belongs in Lite because:

- it improves baseline product clarity
- it reduces configuration sprawl
- users expect a save plugin to expose these basics in one place

### 3. Inspector and Diagnostics

Continue improving editor-facing guidance:

- better source previews
- stronger configuration warnings
- clearer failure messages
- runtime diagnostics when practical

This should help users understand:

- what will be saved
- what failed to resolve
- what restore policy is active
- what global settings apply

### 4. Common Built-In Support

Continue adding carefully selected built-ins for common Godot nodes.

Priority should stay on:

- high-frequency nodes
- obvious state value
- meaningful reduction in handwritten source code

### 5. Documentation and Template Quality

Keep improving:

- shorter integration paths
- clearer examples
- smaller templates
- better decision maps

Lite should continue to be the easiest way to understand the SaveFlow model.

### 6. Business-Facing Save Workflow

Lite should keep improving the parts a real game team touches every day, even
when those needs are not "advanced orchestration".

Priority tracks:

- slot summary and in-game save list workflows
- autosave and checkpoint integration patterns
- slot metadata normalization for real game UI and QA usage

These belong in Lite when they stay within:

- one local save profile
- explicit slot metadata
- explicit save/load entry points
- no migration framework
- no cloud conflict system
- no staged multi-scene scheduler

#### 6.1 Slot summary and in-game save list

Target problem:

- game UI often needs to list saves without loading the full gameplay payload
- QA and designers need fast visibility into which slot is which
- slot rows usually need chapter, map, playtime, difficulty, save type, and similar summary fields

Lite should move toward:

- lightweight slot-summary reads
- a documented slot-summary schema
- a clear split between slot metadata and full save payload
- examples for building an in-game continue/load screen from slot metadata

Recommended Lite acceptance bar:

- a game can render a save list without loading full gameplay state
- slot summary reads are explicit and stable
- compatibility and slot safety can be surfaced in game UI, not only in editor tools

#### 6.2 Autosave and checkpoint integration

Target problem:

- real games save from gameplay events, not only from manual debug actions
- teams need a clean pattern for door transitions, checkpoints, settings changes, and return-to-menu saves
- save requests often need basic gating such as "scene is stable", "combat is not interrupting", or "restore target is valid"

Lite should move toward:

- recommended autosave trigger patterns
- a minimal checkpoint workflow
- guidance for "when a game should refuse to save right now"
- examples that keep autosave orchestration simple and local to gameplay code

Recommended Lite acceptance bar:

- users can wire autosave/checkpoint events without inventing a private save architecture first
- the docs explain when to call `save_scene()`, `save_scope()`, or `save_data()`
- the baseline pattern stays explicit and does not pretend to be a full background-save scheduler

#### 6.3 Slot metadata for business UI

Target problem:

- the slot file often needs business-facing fields beyond technical metadata
- players and QA need labels like chapter name, location name, playtime, save type, or thumbnail reference
- without a clear convention, every project invents incompatible ad-hoc metadata

Lite should move toward:

- a recommended metadata schema for business-facing slot info
- clear guidance for what belongs in slot metadata vs settings vs full gameplay payload
- examples for auto-save, manual save, and checkpoint labels

Recommended Lite acceptance bar:

- users can answer "what should go in slot metadata?" without guessing
- slot metadata is good enough to drive a production save list UI
- the schema stays simple enough that migration pressure does not get pushed down into every Source

### 7. Core Reliability

These always stay in Lite/Core:

- correctness fixes
- better defaults
- safer restore behavior
- clearer editor/runtime warnings
- consistency improvements
- explicit scene/scope restore contracts for currently loaded targets
- version compatibility reporting and baseline load blocking when schema/data versions do not match
- one-slot local backup safety with simple fallback recovery

These are not premium features.

### 8. Baseline C# Parity

Lite/Core should continue to treat C# as a first-class baseline entry path.

That means:

- runtime entrypoints should stay callable from C#
- compatibility inspection should not become GDScript-only
- baseline save/load workflows should remain documented for both languages

This is still part of the base product, not a Pro-only differentiator.

## Suggested Lite Release Direction

- release packaging checks that keep public docs, README, examples, and Asset Library wording aligned

## Current Roadmap Checkpoint

As of `0.1.10`, several roadmap lines have moved from "planned" into baseline
Lite behavior:

- project-level settings and compatibility policy are visible from `SaveFlow Settings`
- slot summary, business metadata, autosave, checkpoint, and active-slot
  patterns are documented and demonstrated in the recommended template
- `SaveFlowTypedDataSource` gives Godot users a lower-boilerplate path for typed
  system/model data, while `SaveFlowTypedStateSource` gives C# users a direct
  graph-source path for one typed state object
- `SaveFlowPipelineControl` and `SaveFlowPipelineSignals` let scenes react to
  local save/load lifecycle stages without subclassing every Source
- C# has baseline runtime entry wrappers and typed-data helpers
- `SaveFlowNodeSource` has stronger authoring diagnostics for missing included
  children, nested Source helpers, and ownership boundaries
- the recommended template is now a scene-authored project workflow instead of
  a set of disconnected UI-only cases
- common built-in coverage already includes the first focused batch of
  high-value object/runtime nodes

As of `0.2.0`, the release line is shifting from adding concepts to hardening
the runtime and release surface:

- the `SaveFlow` singleton has been reduced to a facade over focused runtime
  services for storage, slot lifecycle, metadata, graph execution, pipeline
  lifecycle, DevSaveManager access, and entity restore
- the public runtime API remains stable while internal responsibilities are
  easier to test and maintain
- the next release checkpoint is primarily reliability, packaging, and
  regression confidence, not another feature pillar

That does **not** mean these areas are complete forever.
It means the next Lite work should avoid adding new concepts unless they remove
a concrete adoption or reliability problem.

The largest remaining Lite gap for the next line is now:

- users can compose real scenes correctly, but stale built-in selections,
  incorrect field overrides, ownership mistakes, and incomplete authoring plans
  should become clearer before runtime save/load tests

## Previous 0.5 Working Plan

The next Lite release should be framed as:

- **Built-in final pass and authoring warnings**

The goal is not to add another save model.
The goal is to make the existing node-authored workflow safer:

- common Godot node state should be covered by focused built-ins
- built-in serializer and field selections should not fail silently
- ownership mistakes should remain visible from the node inspector and scene validator
- every new warning should point at a concrete fix

### Must Have

#### 1. Built-in coverage audit

Target problem:

- built-ins reduce boilerplate only when their restore semantics are obvious
- adding too many node types makes Lite harder to explain
- authors need to know when a built-in is enough and when a custom source is better

Lite should audit:

- every registered built-in serializer
- current test coverage for each high-value category
- candidate gaps with a clear "add", "defer", or "do not add" decision

Acceptance bar:

- every built-in has a clear reason to exist
- no new built-in ships without a focused runtime test
- unclear Godot node state is deferred instead of guessed

#### 2. Built-in selection warnings

Target problem:

- `SaveFlowNodeSource` can be edited after the target node type changes
- stale serializer ids and field ids may be filtered out safely at runtime
- safe filtering is still confusing when the author expects that state to save

Lite should warn when:

- `included_target_builtin_ids` contains unsupported serializer ids
- `target_builtin_field_overrides` references an unsupported serializer
- field overrides reference fields that the serializer does not expose

Acceptance bar:

- inspector warnings explain what is ignored and why
- scene validator surfaces those warnings
- save/load behavior remains backwards compatible

#### 3. Entity factory and collection warning pass

Target problem:

- runtime entity save/load is easy to misconfigure
- missing containers, missing factories, missing type keys, or stale prefab setup should be visible before pressing Play
- warnings should explain the node relationship, not just say "invalid"

Lite should tighten:

- prefab factory plan details
- collection source plan details
- double-collection diagnostics
- missing identity guidance

Acceptance bar:

- a user can fix the setup from the node tree and inspector
- custom factories still work without forcing prefab-factory assumptions
- warnings do not become runtime-only logs

#### 4. Scene validator consistency

Target problem:

- users often edit scenes without opening Save Graph tooling
- node warnings and the scene validator badge should agree about the same problems
- duplicate keys and invalid plans should remain easy to find

Lite should ensure:

- source/scope/factory/pipeline warnings flow into the validator
- duplicate source keys stay errors
- incomplete but safe authoring states stay warnings
- each issue includes node path and next-action guidance

#### 5. Documentation

Target problem:

- warnings help only when users understand the underlying ownership model
- built-ins are useful only when users know their boundary

Lite docs should explain:

- when `SaveFlowNodeSource` built-ins are enough
- when to add a child source directly instead of saving the child subtree
- when to use `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource` for runtime containers
- how to fix stale built-in selections and field overrides

### Not In This Release

Keep these out of scope:

- migration frameworks
- cloud save
- cross-device conflict handling
- reference repair systems
- staged multi-scene restore orchestration
- multithreaded seamless save pipelines
- a full save-menu UI framework
- broad setup wizards
- C# parity expansion beyond bug fixes

### Release Readiness Check

Before shipping this release, verify:

1. every new built-in has a focused runtime test
2. every new warning appears in the relevant inspector warning path
3. scene validator shows source/scope/factory/pipeline warnings consistently
4. docs explain the fix, not only the error
5. runtime smoke tests still pass

### 0.5.x Progress Checkpoint

Current progress toward the **Built-in final pass and authoring warnings** release:

- `SaveFlowNodeSource` now reports unsupported target built-in ids and unknown
  target built-in field overrides instead of silently filtering them out.
- `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource` now reports duplicate runtime
  `persistent_id` values, default `Identity` fallback ids, and entity
  `type_key` values that the configured factory cannot handle.
- scene validator regression tests now confirm both the NodeSource built-in
  warnings and EntityCollection identity/factory warnings surface from the
  validator issue list.
- `saveflow-common-authoring-mistakes.md` now includes concrete fixes for stale
  built-ins, invalid field overrides, duplicate entity ids, default identity ids,
  factory type mismatches, and double-collected runtime containers.
- an internal 0.5.x authoring audit now tracks the audit scope, current
  coverage, recommended work order, and release bar.

## Previous 0.6 Working Plan

The 0.6 Lite release was framed as:

- **C# parity and typed-data polish**

The goal is not to create a second C#-only save model.
The goal is to make the existing Lite model equally reachable from C#:

- active-slot and save-card helpers should exist in C# as well as GDScript
- baseline slot, metadata, graph, entity, and validation calls should have thin C# wrappers
- typed metadata and typed data should remain the default C# path for new project code
- docs should show when to use typed helpers instead of raw dictionaries

### 0.6.x Progress Checkpoint

Current progress toward the **C# parity and typed-data polish** release:

- `SaveFlowClient` now exposes more baseline runtime wrappers for slot
  management, metadata reads/writes, validation, graph inspection/application,
  current-data helpers, and entity restore.
- C# now has `SaveFlowSlotWorkflow` and `SaveFlowSlotCard`, matching the
  recommended active-slot/save-list workflow introduced on the GDScript side.
- runtime regression coverage now includes a C# fixture for active-slot metadata,
  save-card summaries, and C# client slot operations.
- C# typed-state sources now own default `State` storage and optional payload
  sections, reducing the boilerplate for source-generated typed state.
- `saveflow-csharp-quickstart.md` now documents active slots, save cards, and
  the expanded C# wrapper surface.
- the recommended template now includes a small C# workflow demo that wires
  `SaveFlowTypedStateSource`, `SaveFlowSlotWorkflow`, `SaveFlowSlotCard`, and
  `SaveFlowClient.SaveScope()`
  in one scene-authored example.

## Next Release Working Plan

The next Lite release should be framed as:

- **Template/demo cleanup and documentation-site foundation**

The goal is not to add another save feature.
The goal is to make the existing Lite workflow easier to learn, evaluate, and
copy into a real Godot project:

- examples should be scene-authored and visually understandable
- each demo should prove one workflow instead of hiding behavior in managers
- public docs should have a stable English information architecture before API freeze
- README, Asset Library wording, in-repo docs, and future website docs should tell the same story

### 0.7.x Must Have

#### 1. Public docs site foundation

Target problem:

- the current docs are useful, but they are scattered across README links and
  in-repo markdown files
- users need a web-friendly entry path similar to a normal product docs site
- docs should be ready before the 0.8 API-freeze beta, not after it

Lite should prepare:

- a docs-site structure for public English documentation
- top-level sections for Getting Started, Core Concepts, Godot Workflows,
  Components, C#, Examples, Troubleshooting, and Roadmap
- a rule for which docs are public Lite docs and which docs remain workspace/internal
- release checks that prevent internal Pro planning docs from being shipped as Lite user docs

Acceptance bar:

- a new user can land on the docs and choose the right first tutorial
- public docs do not expose internal workspace planning
- every public page maps back to an actual Godot workflow or component

#### 2. Template and demo cleanup

Target problem:

- demos can become harder to understand than the plugin if they rely on too
  many manager scripts, hidden dynamic loading, or UI-only explanations
- Lite examples should teach SaveFlow through normal Godot scene composition

Lite should review:

- recommended template scenes
- C# example scenes
- runtime entity examples
- typed data examples
- pipeline signal examples
- any old UI-only or non-interactive cases

Acceptance bar:

- each kept example has one clear reason to exist
- each scene can be understood from the node tree before reading all scripts
- obsolete or duplicate cases are removed instead of maintained forever
- examples use real scene nodes, screen-space UI only where needed, and
  explicit SaveFlow components in the tree

#### 3. Documentation freeze preparation

Target problem:

- 0.8.x should freeze public API shape, so 0.7.x must expose confusing names,
  missing docs, and unclear workflows while they are still cheap to fix

Lite should audit:

- public class and component names
- C# wrapper naming and comments
- typed data and metadata docs
- source ownership docs
- scene validator and authoring warning docs
- save-slot workflow docs

Acceptance bar:

- docs explain the intended workflow before listing API details
- string-key dictionary patterns are avoided in examples unless they are truly
  lower-level escape hatches
- confusing public names are either fixed before 0.8 or explicitly deferred

#### 4. Release packaging and public wording alignment

Target problem:

- GitHub Releases, Asset Library text, README, and docs can drift apart
- users should not see one description in the Asset Library and a different
  product promise in the docs

Lite should align:

- Asset Library description
- README quick-start and feature list
- public docs landing page
- release notes template
- release asset contents

Acceptance bar:

- release assets contain only intended Lite public files
- public wording describes Lite as the baseline save model, not Pro orchestration
- version, Godot compatibility, and installation instructions match everywhere

### Not In This Release

Keep these out of scope:

- new Pro feature implementation
- migration registry or save upgrade pipeline
- cloud sync
- reference repair system
- staged multi-scene restore orchestration
- background save pipeline
- full API freeze

### Release Readiness Check

Before shipping a 0.7.x build, verify:

1. public docs site structure exists and can be built or previewed locally
2. public docs are English-first and exclude internal workspace planning docs
3. kept demos are interactive, scene-authored, and explain their SaveFlow component usage
4. stale or redundant examples are removed from public navigation
5. README, Asset Library wording, release notes, and docs site entry page are aligned
6. runtime and recommended-case regression tests still pass

### 0.7.x Progress Checkpoint

Current progress toward the **Template/demo cleanup and documentation-site
foundation** release:

- `docs-site` now contains the first Docusaurus-based public docs-site source.
- the public docs information architecture now has first-pass sections for
  Getting Started, Core Concepts, Godot Workflows, Components, C#, Examples,
  Troubleshooting, and Roadmap.
- an internal 0.7.x public-docs inventory classifies the current Lite docs as
  keep, rewrite, merge, internal, or QA-only.
- release sync now includes `docs-site` in the public repository projection,
  while `.gitattributes` still keeps Godot Asset Library archives limited to
  `addons/`.
- the public repository projection now includes a GitHub Pages workflow for
  building and deploying the docs site from `docs-site`.
- the first content migration pass now covers Save Graph, ownership,
  Source choice, NodeSource, typed data, entity collections, Scopes, slot
  workflow, pipeline signals, editor tools, C#, examples, and troubleshooting.
- the docs site now includes a Reference section for key GDScript runtime calls,
  Source contracts, component properties, slot metadata, pipeline signals, and
  C# wrapper APIs.
- `docs-site` now builds successfully with Docusaurus 3.10 on Node 24/npm 11.

## Previous 0.4 Working Plan

The 0.4 Lite release was framed as:

- **Business save-slot workflow polish**

Current completed scope:

- `SaveFlowSlotWorkflow` centralizes active slot index, slot-id templates,
  slot-id overrides, typed metadata construction, and save-card construction.
- `SaveFlowSlotCard` provides typed card data for in-game continue/load/save UI
  without loading full gameplay payloads.
- the recommended project workflow template uses the helper for main-scene and
  subscene slot cards while keeping save/load calls explicit.
- runtime tests cover active slot save/delete behavior, autosave/checkpoint
  writes to the active slot only, and recommended template card summaries.

## Previous 0.3 Working Plan

The 0.3 Lite release was framed as:

- **Preflight + reliability polish**

The goal is not to add Pro-style orchestration.
The goal is to make the existing Lite workflow harder to misconfigure and safer
to release.

### Must Have

#### 1. Setup Health / Preflight v2

Target problem:

- setup health currently checks installation and C# basics
- source previews catch local mistakes, but users still need one place to see
  whether the current scene has obvious SaveFlow authoring problems

This release should extend `SaveFlow Settings > Setup Health` with current-scene
preflight checks for:

- source count and scope count
- empty or duplicate source keys
- invalid `SaveFlowNodeSource`, `SaveFlowTypedDataSource`, `SaveFlowDataSource`,
  `SaveFlowEntityCollectionSource`, and entity-factory plans
- common ownership mistakes that already appear in source plans

Acceptance bar:

- a user can open the scene and immediately see whether the SaveFlow graph is
  obviously safe to test
- invalid scene authoring shows up in one project-level place, not only after
  selecting the exact broken node
- this remains diagnostics only; it must not auto-rewrite the user's save graph

#### 2. Release tooling hardening

Target problem:

- release automation should be boring
- a missing GitHub Release or remote branch race should not require manual
  intervention after assets are already generated

This release should:

- make `gh release view` failure fall through to release creation
- fetch/rebase the public sync worktree before syncing and before pushing
- keep release asset validation unchanged

Acceptance bar:

- running `publish_saveflow_lite.ps1 -PushChanges -CreateRelease` can create a
  new release when it does not already exist
- if the public repo moved forward before push, the script rebases or fails
  clearly before publishing the tag

#### 3. Focused built-in follow-up

Target problem:

- built-ins should continue to reduce handwritten object-state code
- coverage should not drift into arbitrary UI persistence or obscure node state

This release may add a small follow-up batch only if each node passes this bar:

- common in gameplay scenes
- has obvious restore value
- can be explained in one sentence
- has a focused runtime test

Candidate areas:

- collision shape enabled/disabled state
- collision layer/mask for authored interactables
- other common runtime toggles that users currently store by hand

#### 4. Slot UI polish without new architecture

Target problem:

- the slot-summary APIs and demo exist, but the recommended save-list workflow
  can still be easier to copy into real projects

This release may tighten:

- recommended slot metadata names
- in-game save-card examples
- docs explaining active slot index vs storage key vs display name

### Not In This Release

The next Lite release should **not** become a grab-bag of unrelated bigger
systems.

Keep these out of scope:

- migration frameworks
- cloud save
- reference repair systems
- staged multi-scene restore orchestration
- multithreaded seamless save pipelines
- heavy editor automation or wizard-style setup systems
- a large new panel just to explain features already covered by Quick Access,
  Setup Health, or existing previews

### Release Readiness Check

Before shipping this next Lite release, verify:

1. `Setup Health` reports both setup and current-scene authoring issues clearly
2. release automation can create or update a GitHub release without manual
   fallback
3. the recommended template still demonstrates the same core ownership models
4. smoke tests still pass for:
   - recommended cases
   - editor entry points
   - core runtime save/load behavior

### 0.3.x Progress Checkpoint

Current progress toward the **Preflight + reliability polish** release:

- `Setup Health / Preflight v2` now has a scene validator badge, current-scene
  source/scope/factory checks, pipeline signal checks, component breakdowns,
  and next-action guidance.
- `Release tooling hardening` now validates version consistency before sync,
  requires a clean public sync worktree, fetches/rebases before sync and push,
  and keeps release asset validation unchanged.
- the focused built-in follow-up extends common gameplay coverage with
  `RayCast2D` / `RayCast3D` sensor state so authored interactables, traps, and
  detection rays need less handwritten state code.
- slot workflow copy now clarifies active slot index, storage key, display name,
  and the rule that autosave/checkpoint events write the active slot rather than
  every visible save card.

Remaining 0.3.x work should now stay limited to release QA unless a regression
or packaging issue appears.

## What Lite Should Explicitly Avoid

Do not overload Lite with:

- advanced reference resolution
- migration frameworks
- multithreaded seamless save pipelines
- high-complexity orchestration systems
- premium delivery/security profiles beyond the baseline
- cloud sync transport and conflict workflows
- multi-scene restore schedulers or staged resource-loading coordinators

Those are better left to `Pro`.

## Relationship To Commercial Projects

Lite/Core should still be enough to build a real save system in a serious project.

That means Lite/Core must continue owning:

- Save Graph
- Restore Contract
- compatibility reporting
- baseline backup safety
- project-level diagnostics

But once the project problem changes from:

- "how do I save this object/system/runtime set?"

to:

- "how do I orchestrate multi-stage restore?"
- "how do I migrate old saves?"
- "how do I sync local and cloud state?"
- "how do I repair references after restore?"

the project has naturally crossed into `Pro` territory.
